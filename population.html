            <h1>Zaza Population</h1>
                <p class="top">Being one of the biggest nationality with no country, Zazas have between 2-4 millions population across the world. First Zaza settlements in history are established around Murat and Dicle rivers and there has never been substantial immigration from there. Turkey has the biggest Zaza population with nearly 1.5 million. Southeast Anatolia, especially Diyarbakır, and East Anatolia are the regions that host most of the Zaza population. Apart from Turkey, Syria, Irak, Iran are other Asian countries that have Zaza Population. Last but not least, there is a significant amount of Zaza Population in both Europe and USA due to the immigration from Turkey after political problems in the late 1900’s.</p>
