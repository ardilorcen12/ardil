                <h1>Zaza Population</h1>
                <h3 class="top" style="color: white !important;">Being one of the biggest nationality with no country,
                    Zazas have
                    between 2-4 millions
                    population across the world. First Zaza settlements in history are established around Murat and
                    Dicle
                    rivers and there has never been substantial immigration from there. Turkey has the biggest Zaza
                    population with nearly 1.5 million. Southeast Anatolia, especially Diyarbakır, and East Anatolia are
                    the
                    regions that host most of the Zaza population. Apart from Turkey, Syria, Irak, Iran are other Asian
                    countries that have Zaza Population. Last but not least, there is a significant amount of Zaza
                    Population in both Europe and USA due to the immigration from Turkey after political problems in the
                    late 1900’s.</h3>
