            <h1>Zaza History</h1>
            <h3 style="color: white !important;"> Although Zazas are seen as a dialect of the Kurdish language by many people, they have their own distinct historical backgrounds. There are different theories about the origin of Zazas:
                
1-	The theory related to Part Empire
2-	The theory related to immigration from the Caspian Sea
                
The first theory depends on the similarities between languages. Part Empire was an empire located in the northeast of Iran and was built before the Sasanians. According to some linguistic scientists such as Kaveh Farrokh and Jost Gippert, there is a close relationship between the Zaza language and the Part language. After Part Empire, the Sasanid Empire was built in the same geography which is interpreted by some historians as the sign of the Zaza and Sasanian association. Even some historians think the Zaza people and the language are coming from the Sasanid Empire. After the Byzantines demolished Sasanid Empire, the remaining people hid in the mountains for 400 years of Byzantine dominion. With Turks invading Anatolia, the Byzantines got weaker which provided an opportunity for the Zaza people to regain their establishments in Anatolia and northern Iran.
The second theory is all about a single word “Dımıli” which is a word used to describe Zazas. The word “Dımıli” also means people from Deylem which is located on the south shores of the Caspian Sea. So, scientists like Minorsky, W.B. Lockwood, Karl Hadank, and Arthur Christensen suggest that the Zaza people immigrated from Deylem. The one resource they depend on other than the word Dımıli is the Behustin epitaph. In this epitaph, it is written that the language people in Deylem speak is Zuzu, which is now known as Zaza.
There are some sources that give us information about Zaza’s existence in Anatolia such as Evliya Çelebi’s famous travel book. Another resource is C. Niebuhr’s travel book, which is also the first time that Zazas are seen in Western history.
